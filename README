ARM Mali BSP layer
==================

These recipes provide a BSP layer for ARM development platforms with
ARM Mali technology enabled.  To build a minimal Poky image for
ODROID-XU3 which features a Mali-T62x GPU.

* Get Poky meta-data with:
    git clone -b daisy git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky.git

* Prepare the build environment:
    cd poky && source oe-init-build-env

* Add path to meta-mali in poky/build/conf/bblayers.conf

* Set MACHINE to odroidxu3 in poky/build/conf/local.conf

* Build a basic image with:
    bitbake core-image-minimal

* If you get this error:
    Please use a umask which allows a+rx and u+rwx

  then run this command and try again:
    umask 022

* When the build is complete, a full SD card image will be ready to be
  written to an SD card to boot the ODROID-XU3:
    tmp/deploy/images/odroidxu3/core-image-minimal-odroidxu3.sdcard

  For example, if your SD card device is /dev/sdX (adjust as appropriate):
    dd if=core-image-minimal-odroidxu3.sdcard of=/dev/sdX bs=1M


ARM Mali GPU User-side drivers
==============================

The recipes-graphics directory contains recipes to download user-side
Mali GPU proprietary binary drivers which are distributed under an
End-User License Agreement (EULA).  This agreement needs to be read
and accepted prior to running the recipes.  The full text of the EULA
is included in the EULA file.

Standard binary user-side drivers are automatically downloaded by the
recipes from the official website:

    http://malideveloper.arm.com/develop-for-mali/drivers/

To add the user-side binary to your build, add this line to local.conf:

    IMAGE_INSTALL_append = "mali-userspace-t62x"

To show that you have read and accepted the terms of the EULA and
enable the recipes, add this line to local.conf:

    ACCEPT_MALI_EULA = "1"

Because the Mali recipes provide EGL and OpenGL ES but not OpenGL,
there is a conflict with the Mesa recipes which are needed for X11 and
Wayland.  So the current Mali GPU support in Yocto does not work with
windowing systems but only "directfb" mode (a.k.a "fbdev").  The
core-image-minimal includes X11, so to convert it to "directfb" you
will also need to add these two lines to local.conf:

    DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " directfb sysvinit"
    DISTRO_FEATURES_remove = " x11 wayland"

With these modifications done in local.conf, building the image again
will produce a new SD card image with the Mali GPU drivers enabled:

    bitbake core-image-minimal
